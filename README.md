# GeoHub LA Data Collection
> **Note:** This repo has been merged into Hack for LA's district-files: [https://github.com/hackforla/district-files]. Ongoing development is there.


## Overview
This project collects **district boundary files** for various political and administrative districts within Los Angeles County.  
The data is converted into both **raw JSON** and **GeoJSON** formats for easy use in civic tech projects.  
The processed data will be contributed to **Hack for LA**.

## Data Collection Process
The data collection process is facilitated using the [GeoHub LA County Website](https://geohub.lacity.org/search?collection=Dataset) and related ArcGIS APIs.

### Steps
1. **Authentication**: No key required.  
2. **Requesting Data**: Python script sends requests to API endpoints for each district.  
3. **Data Processing**: Responses are saved in two formats:
   - Raw ArcGIS JSON (`district.json`)
   - GeoJSON (`district.geojson`)
4. **Data Storage**: Output files are stored in `shapefiles_output/`.  
5. **Automation**: A GitHub Actions workflow will be configured to run this process on a weekly or monthly basis via update_shapefiles.yml.
